This package contains several useful functions for operating on pairs
of a value and a list of side-effects. Side-effects do not have to be external
Elm events - they can be internal app events, such as a message indicating that
the score of your game should increase, or that you want to navigate the app
back to the home page.

More documentation coming soon!
